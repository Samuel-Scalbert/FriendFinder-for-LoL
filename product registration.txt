My goal is to create a small application for me and my friends to keep tracks about who's winning. The aim is to create :
- a leaderboard only with the friends you want 
- the winrate for each day you played 
- a graph to show the LP loss / win 

I'm  a big fan of LOL and I just wanted to train with API for my studies, so I decided to try to create this project.

Best regards
